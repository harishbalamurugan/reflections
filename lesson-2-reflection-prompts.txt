What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A directory called .git is created, with files containing meta-data inside 
it. This is to track the history and any other information related to 
the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area helps you to ensure you are only committing the changes that you 
want to a repository. Hence, it is better for developers to commit only the changes 
they want (unlike others) and not commit the entire repository.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

The staging area can be used to hold changes to files before committing them to the 
repository. Hence, we can make sure that only one logical change is held by 
the staging area before a commit so that one commit per logical change is 
achieved.

You can use git diff --staged to ensure you are making one commit per logical 
change by viewing the content of the files.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Situations in which I would want to create an experimental change without breaking 
the original code/system. This way, my history will also be organised as I would 
not need to clutter up the history of my main branch with experimental features.



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It is easier to visualise how each branch relates to one another. More importantly, 
it helps to visualise the commits that are not reachable by any other commits.




What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Commits in both branches are combined to form on history of commits. This gives 
the feeling that the branches have been merged. That's why the diagram shows 
both history of commits "maintained" by both branches that combines themselves 
into one commit.



What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
