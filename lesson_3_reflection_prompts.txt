When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I want to share my codes for others to view
When I am working on a group project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically pulls changes, our code may not be ready to integrate 
with the changes. As a result, bugs might be introduced. Hence, it is better 
to pull changes manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks
	- They are a clone of another repository residing on the servers of 
	  Github. This is done when one wants to clone a repository that 
	  he or she is interested in, but it is not their's. Basically, 
	  when one wants to work on a project that is not their's, they can 
	  use this to start their modifications from that project.

Clones
	- They are just a copy of another repository, be it local or from 
	  Github. This is done when one needs a copy of repository from online 
	  locally. It is similar to downloading an online repository.

Branches
	- Branches are copies of a local repository which can be used to 
	  add and test experimental features before merging with the main 
	  branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
